# Smoke-detector

**Components required**
1. Arduino uno (Hardware)
2. MQ2 sensor (Hardware)
3. Buzzer (Hardware)
4. Battery (Hardware)
5. Jumping wires (Hardware)
6. USB cable (Hardware)
7. Arduino IDE (Software)

**Steps To Follow**
1. Buy all the above mentioned components and install Aeduino IDE Software in your Laptop/PC.
2. Connect the wires with the components as shown in circuit diagram in images folder.
3. In tools tab select board as Arduino uno.
4. Connect the usb cable one to your laptop and other to arduino uno. 
5. Add the code to Arduino IDE, first verify the code the compiler will tell if any error in console and if everything is clear then upload the code.
6. The code is successfully uploaded unplug the usb cable and make a smoke around mq2 sensor, it will sense the smoke and make a buzzer sound.
